# Jupyter Quality Extension

An interactive, lifecycle-aware quality assessment tool for research software developed in Jupyter Notebooks.  
This tool is designed for research software and helps researchers evaluate notebook quality using relevant metrics based on the software's development stage.

## Features

- Assess the quality of Jupyter-based research software projects
- Metrics tailored to different lifecycle stages (e.g., Development, Maintenance)
- Interactive notebook-based interface with pass/fail icons and improvement suggestions
- Automatically converts `.ipynb` notebooks into `.py` scripts for metric compatibility
- Modular design for easy extension and maintenance

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yutong0310/jupyter-quality-extension.git
cd jupyter-quality-extension
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open any notebook you want to analyze 

3. In a code cell, run:

```python
%run extension.py
```

4. A user interface will appear with:
   - Dropdown for lifecycle stage selection
   - Input for target path or GitHub repository URL
   - Quality scan results displayed in notebook
